## M-git

Developed a source code management tool using Python, similar to git.

Implemented commands such as init, add, checkout, commit, rebase, log etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sreshth01/m-git.git
   ```
2. Run the following command using Terminal/Shell
   ```sh
   chmod +x m-git
   ```

## Usage

This tool can be used in the following way:
   ```sh
   m-git TASK <arg-1,arg-2.....>
   ```
 where "TASK" is what you want to perform. Eg. init/add/commit etc.
 and arg-1/arg-2 are the arguments passed to perform the task. 
 The number of arguments depends on the task you wish to perform.
 
 For eg.
   ```sh
   m-git init MyProject
   ```
 will create a repository of name "MyProject".
 Here init is the TASK, and it has 1 argument "MyProject", i.e. the repository name.
